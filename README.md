# NoticeHub – Smart Digital Circular Management
> A web-based platform to create, manage, and distribute digital circular notices efficiently.

## Problem Statement 2.5: Digital Circular & Notice Management Platform

- View all circulars in a centralized dashboard
- Read tracking (who read / who hasn’t)

- Circular creation with rich text formatting
- Searchable archive of past notices
- Analytics dashboard (reach %, read rate, engagement)
- Role-based access control (Admin & User)
